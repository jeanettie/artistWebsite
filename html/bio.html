      <img src="../images/Buttons/statement.jpg" alt="Artist Statement: I use a variety of media as a result of letting my concepts determine the path of my work.  Common reoccuring themes of my work are time, process, and permanence.  Usually, one or more of these themes is combined with other ideas from the subjects of history, religion, psychology, geology, and sociology.  Iâ€™m interested in how humanity connects and constricts the larger universe by the creation and control of our own realities.   How do our realities offer us permanence through correct practices?  My imagery is often a question or critique of the values we attribute to the rules and objects we create in a society and/or the celebration of the freedom created from letting go.">
